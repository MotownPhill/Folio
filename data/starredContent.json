I am better for my drug use.”</p><h6>\n<img src=\"https://ssl.ulximg.com/public/userfiles/2021/02/20/GettyImages-457075522.jpg\" alt=\"Columbia, Heroin\" width=\"1080\" height=\"719\"><br>Bryan Bedder / Getty Images</h6><p>Hart also avocates for drug reform in the United States and references the war on drugs as being a failed idea. He believes that drug use can help people who are not at risk for addiction with their “work-life balance.”</p><p>He adds: “A large percentage of people who meet criteria for addiction have co-occurring psychiatric illnesses: depression, anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, a wide range of other psychiatric illnesses. A large percentage of them also have other illnesses. They may be pain patients. So that increases the likelihood of them becoming addicted … Another reason is that some people just have not developed responsibility skills. They haven’t developed an ability to exercise inhibitory control. It’s just one of these things that develops over time.”</p><p>“You could have a massive public-service-announcement campaign that says ‘If you’re going to use opioids, don’t use alcohol as a background or other sedatives in combination, because it increases the likelihood of respiratory depression and death,’” he continued.</p><p><em>Drug Use for Grown-ups: Chasing Liberty in the Land of Fear </em>is available now.</p><p>[<a href=\"https://www.complex.com/life/carl-hart-columbia-professor-heroin-every-day\">Via</a>]</p>\n                \n                                <img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/realhotnewhiphop/~4/3IEvE4ux9ao\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\">"

One of these cracks is referred to as the &quot;Crack Monster&quot;, which was apparently so unsettling that it &quot;scarred him for life&quot;. After all was said and done, Jon would end up spending about THIRTY FUCKING YEARS looking for the short. THIRTY. He considered it his life's work. Listen.

The fact that there were multiple accounts of its existence, but little to no information on it anywhere, was what made it start garnering attention on the internet.

But it's super interesting, I'd recommend checking it out for yourself. Let's just skip to the weird part. After years of searching, Armond received a fax to his workplace with an untraceable number. It read: &quot;WE HAVE THE COPY&quot; Additionally, they said they would send him said copy of the short, on one condition: he was to never show it publicly, or post it online in any way.

Armond gets a letter, which says \"WE TRUST THIS COMPLETES YOUR SEARCH\" Also enclosed in the envelope is a DVD. To clarify, he received it on a SUNDAY.

So now he has it. And he tells people he has it, but that no one else can see it. Which is, of course, INCREDIBLY unsatisfying to the people online who have also been searching for it, right? Enter Dycaite, the founder of the Lost Media Wiki. So Dycaite started looking into it as well.

Dycaite didn't hesitate, which is how we got the version of CRACKS that I linked. With the newfound context provided by the video, it actually makes complete sense that it was only aired a few times. This short was made right before the word &quot;Crack&quot; became widely known as a euphemism for drugs, which is how you get characters like &quot;The Crack Monkey&quot;.

It SEEMS like it should just be a classic story of formerly lost media, cartoon stops airing, gets lost, people online find it again. We even know WHY it was lost, not because it was &quot;too scary&quot; or whatever, just because it didn't age well. But there's still SO MUCH mystery surrounding CRACKS.

The person who contacted Dycaite also didn't seem to care if the short was released to the public. Armond still hasn't released his version of the recording to the public, though has apparently shown it to a few people privately. So why all the secrecy? And why was Jon Armond given a copy?
