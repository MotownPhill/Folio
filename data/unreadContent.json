CNN's John Berman called out two of them, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, during an October 11 broadcast of the morning show \"New Day.\" </p><p>Berman, who hosts \"New Day\" with his CNN colleague Brianna Keilar, told viewers, \"(Trump's) rewritten history is now practically the official dogma of his party — and his lies, the accepted reality of his party.\"</p><p>To illustrate his point, Berman showed interviews with Scalise and Grassley — who appeared with Trump at a MAGA rally in Iowa on Saturday, October 9. The following day, Scalise was interviewed by Fox News' Chris Wallace.</p><p>Wallace, one of the few people at Fox News who asks MAGA Republicans tough questions, bluntly asked Scalise, \"So, you think the election was stolen?\" — and Scalise jumped through hoops to dodge the question. Berman slammed that interview as \"Minority Whip Scalise perpetuating a lie about 2020.\" And he went on to show a clip of the 88-year-old Grassley being interviewed by Newsmax TV and defending Trump's refusal to accept the 2020 election results.</p><p>Berman told viewers, \"On the Senate side, 88-year-old Chuck Grassley <em>is</em> the Republican establishment. On his decades-long career, no one would have called him a radical — until now…. Grassley is trying to paint Trump as a victim of the attempted coup when in fact, it was Trump himself driving it.\"</p><p>Berman noted, \"Trump asked the Justice Department nine times to undermine the election results. He successfully got his White House staff to help pressure — he tried to pressure secretaries of state to not certify the election. He then attacked them, including Republicans…. Trump also tried to pressure state legislatures in key battleground states. Then he tried to get the courts to overturn the election results based on bogus conspiracies.\"</p><p>The \"New Day\" host continued, \"A Trump lawyer wrote a blueprint. He wrote it down, outlining how Mike Pence could overturn the election. And speaking of Pence, Trump publicly and loudly tried to get his vice president to decertify the election on January 6. And then, the mob showed up. It is worth noting Trump is still spouting these conspiracies, including at the rally that Grassley attended and participated in.\"</p><p> Watch the video below:</p><p>\r\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/BKUBCeyQ-Vk?rel=0\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\r\n<small>CNN coup</small>\r\n<small>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKUBCeyQ-Vk\">www.youtube.com</a>\r\n</small>\r\n</p><img align=\"left\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/669469016/0/alternet\">"

        "content": "<p>Bronco. Every. Time.</p><p>This has been my motto while playing the preview build of <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, the latest iteration of Playground Games’ open-world racing series. Horizon is the chill, microdosing cousin of Forza Motorsport, with festival vibes, ridiculous race tracks set in lush environments, and, of course, a virtual garage full of gorgeous vehicles.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/478bf7e0-2a23-11ec-bc7b-106779bd1028\" alt=\"Forza Horizon 5\"><figcaption></figcaption><div>Playground Games</div></figure><p><em>Horizon 5</em> takes place in a fictionalized Mexico, which makes it the perfect stomping ground for the 2021 Ford Bronco, an SUV that I’ve been drooling over for more than a year in real life. It’s the first new model in 25 years, it’s styled after the first-generation Bronco that Ford rolled out in 1965, and, best of all, it comes in a cactus gray colorway. However, for a multitude of reasons — the global chip shortage, supply-chain slowdowns and the sheer expense of it all — I’m not likely to get my feet on the pedals of a new Bronco any time soon. That’s where <em>Horizon 5</em> comes in.</p><p><em>Horizon 5</em> begins with a yellow Bronco Badlands strapped to the floor of a plane, ramp lowered behind it with clear sky soaring by. Starting the game drops the vehicle out of the plane, parachuting you onto the rim of a snow-capped volcano. Immediately, you’re driving at high speeds, following a trail down the fiery mountain and getting a feel for the Bronco. It moves like a heavy piece of machinery, tilting on quick turns and cannonballing down the road, sturdy yet sensitive. (The obligatory, “I like my partners the way I like my SUVs” goes here.)</p><p>And then the next car drops from the sky — a zippy 2020 Corvette Stingray Coupe that drives much differently than the Bronco, turning on a dime and floating over the road. After a few minutes with that, a 1989 Porsche 911 Desert Flyer parachutes past a herd of flamingos, zooming down forest trails with fantastic handling. Finally, the Mercedes-AMG One, a superfast hybrid sports car, finishes the ride by racing an airplane.</p><figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e3066fe0-2a21-11ec-b7ff-3a44978edea9\" alt=\"Forza Horizon 5\"><figcaption></figcaption><div>Playground Games</div></figure><p>Each of the starting vehicles has its own sensibilities and strengths. They all finally land at the Horizon Festival, a massive music and racing extravaganza held in the Mexico desert. This is the main hub of the game, and it’s a party atmosphere filled with bright pink signs, crowds of cheering fans and a ceaseless barrage of fireworks, confetti and hot air balloons.</p><p>This is where you’re given the chance to pick a vehicle for the first time, and it’s the origin of my <em>Horizon 5</em> mantra: Bronco. Every. Time.</p><p>It’s not that the Bronco is the fastest or smoothest vehicle in the game, but it feels right rolling through the rugged desert landscape. It’s the vehicle I want to be driving in real life, and it’s incredibly satisfying to maneuver it up winding mountain roads, along charming city streets and into the heart of massive dust storms.</p><p>To be fair, I don’t actually pick the Bronco <em>every</em> time — there are some races that the SUV simply can’t win, given its top speed and wide turns, and for these I’ll happily use one of the sports cars. But when it comes to exploring, I’m all about the Bronco.</p> <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fe3b28a0-2a21-11ec-bfe6-5a0db367c5ff\" alt=\"Forza Horizon 5\"> <p>That said, all of the vehicles in <em>Horizon 5</em> are magic. They get cracks in the windows and dents in the doors, but they’re truly indestructible and no matter how many backflips they do, they always land tires-down. Plus, if you mess up a turn or run into an immovable object, you’re able to rewind time. In the end, <em>Horizon 5</em> is a cactus-lined fever dream of racing, leaping and crashing, and then resetting and doing it all again.</p><p>The preview includes the first 90 minutes or so of <em>Horizon 5</em>, offering a world map with a handful of races to complete and bonuses to earn by driving around and smashing up the environment. There are multiple layers of customization in the game, from character creation and accessorizing, to vehicle designs and purchases. The preview ends as you unlock your first house of the game, a beautiful pink casita surrounded by cacti and mountains.</p><p>I’m playing <em>Horizon 5</em> on Xbox Series S, the mid-range platform for this title. It’s heading to PC, Xbox Series X and S, and the Xbox One family of consoles, and the main difference among these platforms will be graphical fidelity and loading times. Xbox One players will see loading screens, while PC and Series players won’t, since those platforms can take advantage of SSDs. There’s also no raytracing on the Xbox One versions.</p><div><div><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/FYH9n37B7Yw?rel=0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div><p>On Series S, <em>Horizon 5</em> runs smoothly and looks beautiful so far, maxing out at a resolution of 1920 x 1080 and 60fps without raytracing. The final version will be capped at 30fps with raytracing, but this feature wasn’t live in the Series S preview build. Playground Games promises the raytracing mode will be in the Series S edition at launch. Even without the boost, <em>Horizon 5</em> is a treat to look at, with four distinct biomes, dynamic weather and seasons, and dense, lived-in environments.</p><p>After more than a year of restricted travel and stay-at-home orders across the globe, <em>Horizon 5</em> is a delightful, easygoing escape. It’s lighthearted yet intensely detailed, with realistic environments and vehicles, and it offers whatever type of challenge you want. There are multiple difficulty settings for each race, but there’s also the option to just ride around, drive up the side of a volcano or cruise along the beach. <em>Horizon 5 </em>is the escape I need right now, and bonus, I get to do it in the Bronco of my dreams.</p><p><em>Forza Horizon 5 </em>is due out on November 9th and it’ll be included in Xbox Game Pass.</p>"

CNN's Anderson Cooper recently interviewed Bernstein and Dean separately, getting Bernstein's thoughts on Trump's attempt to pressure U.S. Department of Justice officials to help him overturn the 2020 election results.</p><p>The U.S. Senate recently <a href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.alternet.org/2021/10/internet-explodes-with-reactions-to-bombshell-senate-judiciary-report-on-trumps-efforts-to-pressure-doj-into-helping-him-overturn-the-election/\">issued a damning report</a> on Trump's efforts to bully DOJ officials in December 2020 and early January 2021. Discussing that report with Cooper, the 77-year-old Bernstein said, \"There has been a coup, led by the president of the United States to undermine the Constitution — and possibly and likely, a criminal conspiracy as well. And all of these things that are laid out in the report are incontrovertible evidence of the president of the United States trying to overwhelm constitutional responsibility, the laws of the United States and the Constitution of the United States.\"</p><p>Bernstein went on to say that \"we are looking at an ongoing cover-up, led by the Republican Party to keep the people of the United States from knowing what the hell happened…. The president of the United States, for the first time in our history, tried to subvert a legal and free election. And now, we are heading toward the next election in which these same forces are planning to subvert the elections. So, we are in a constitutional crisis…. We're in it, we're in it.\"</p><p>Those are powerful words coming from Bernstein, who is famous for historic reporting on Watergate with his Washington Post colleague, Bob Woodward, during the 1970s. B</p><p>In a separate interview, Dean, now 82, discussed Trump's efforts to prevent Republicans from testifying for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's select committee on the January 6 insurrection. Dean, a Watergate whistleblower and former attorney who testified before Congress during the 1970s, pled guilty to a single felony charge for his role in the Watergate coverup.</p><p>Trump is urging Republicans to defy subpoenas from the committee, and Dean told Cooper, \"He has no authority to do that. Each of those people have to decide what they can do, and they can't say, 'Well, I'm acting under the orders of former President Trump.' That's no order. It is meaningless.\"</p><p>Water the video below:</p><p>\r\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/UZ7DXFehPj8?rel=0\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\r\n<small>'There has been a coup': Bernstein on Trump's role in January 6 riot</small>\r\n<small>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/alternet/~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ7DXFehPj8\">www.youtube.com</a>\r\n</small>\r\n</p><img align=\"left\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/669465300/0/alternet\">"

It normally starts at $999, but Amazon has, once again, knocked the price down to $850. That's for the 256GB model, but the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2YAPcAZ\">512GB model</a> is also $150 off, bringing it down to $1,099. We've seen this discount come and go pretty quickly over the past couple of months, so now's a good time to grab the laptop if you've wanted to upgrade to a daily driver.</p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3oQk4I5\">Buy MacBook Air M1 (256GB) at Amazon - $850</a><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2YAPcAZ\">Buy MacBook Air M1 (512GB) at Amazon - $850</a><p>The Air M1 earned a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html\">score of 94</a> from us when it came out about one year ago, thanks in part to its thin-and-light design, lovely Retina display, comfortable keyboard and trackpad and impressive performance. The former comes from Apple's M1 chipset and you'll immediately notice the performance gains if you're coming from an older MacBook. The laptop wakes almost instantly when you open the lid, native apps run smoothly and the machine is, on the whole, quite responsive. The GPU performance is better as well — while we still wouldn't run intense games on the Air M1, it can handle Apple Arcade titles and even <em>Fortnite</em> easily.</p><p>We also appreciate how quiet the MacBook Air M1 is because it lacks a fan inside. You won't hear constant whirring when you're putting the laptop through its paces, and you'll be able to do so for up to 16 hours since the machine has an excellent battery life. The biggest hassles you'll deal with on the Air M1 are its paltry 720p webcam and its two USB-C ports, the latter of which means you'll be living the dongle life for a little while longer. But if you can deal with those minor infractions, you'll still get a solid laptop that can go with you almost anywhere in the MacBook Air M1.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>"

If the regular $200 price has been holding you back, you can now pick up a pair at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3iLHOt1\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/e4E5D1\">Best Buy</a> for just $128, or 36 percent off the regular price. That's substantially lower than the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000-xm3-earbuds-drop-to-150-during-best-buy-flash-sale-amazon-match-122514297.html\">$150 sale</a> from Best Buy and Amazon last month. </p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3iLHOt1\">Buy Sony WF-1000XM3 wireless earbuds at Amazon - $128</a><a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/e4E5D1\">Buy Sony WF-1000XM3 wireless earbuds at Best Buy - $128</a><p>With an outstanding 89 score in our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-31-sony-wf-1000xm3-review-true-wireless-earbuds.html\">Engadget review</a>, the WF-1000XM3 took the top spot in our 2019 wireless earbuds buyer's guide. That's largely thanks to the excellent sound quality with bass that's powerful yet clear, bright highs and solid performance for all types of music. The active noise cancellation is the best in the business, blocking out most background noise, while running an excellent six hours on a charge with ANC enabled. You can even tailor that sound using Sony's companion app. </p><p>These main downside of this model is the bulky design of the buds and case, which were changed with the current $299 WF-1000XM4 model — which now tops our wireless earphone <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html\">buyer's guide</a>. Its six hours of battery life is also less than the eight hours offered by the new model. Apart from those things, however, the WF-1000XM3 model can hold its own against any wireless earphones in the areas that count. For $128, it's available at nearly 60 percent less than its successor, and substantially less than anything else that can even remotely compete.</p>"
